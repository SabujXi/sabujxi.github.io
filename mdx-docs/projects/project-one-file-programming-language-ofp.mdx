# Creating a programming language from scratch

Writing code is tough for many people. It needs careful attention to detail and a good grasp on programming languages.
Beginners often struggle with getting the syntax right and fixing errors.
It takes time and patience.

<br />

Then again knowing algorithms and data structures is crucial, but it can be hard for those new to computer science.
Predicting and planning for potential issues is also tricky. For most of the people coding or programming languages 
are languages of aliens.

<br />

It is evident that then how challenging is the journey of creating a programming language.

But, I was thrilled to emberk on the journey. Over the years I created several programming languages, including domain specific languages and general purpose languages.
No, they are not on the list of the popular ones - actually other than people who know me or worked
with me don't know about them. Still I gave enormous efforts on the development of them and it was an exciting journey.

<br />

On this journey of inventing programming languages I implemented a projgramming language called
One File Programming Language or OFP in short. It is used to teach how to create and implement programming languages 
at various international universities targeting masters of CS studentst.
